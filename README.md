# Day-Planner

## DESCRIPTION

A simple in-browser scheduler that allows you to plan your day from 9 am to 9 pm, complete with local date and time recognition and color-coded hours based on past, present, and future. Any events added are saved locally, so closing the browser will not wipe out your perfectly planned day!

## HEADER

![header](https://github.com/luvwitch/Day-Planner/blob/main/assets/header.png?raw=true "header")

A jumbotron that contains the page title, a brief description, and the current date and time.

## SCHEDULE

![schedule](https://github.com/luvwitch/Day-Planner/blob/main/assets/schedule.png?raw=true "schedule")

Each hour from 9am-9pm has its own timeblock with the time labeled, an input textbox that allows you to assign tasks/notes to that hour, and a button to save what you've typed in. Finish a task? Delete the text about that task from inside the textbox and save again! The Text of any saved events will show up as white in past and future boxes and deep blue in the present box so tasks are easily identified apart from the placeholder text.

## COLOR CODING

![colorcoding](https://github.com/luvwitch/Day-Planner/blob/main/assets/colorcode.png?raw=true "color gradient")

As the hours pass by, anything in the past, present, or future will be set along a three color gradient that helpfully indicates what hour it currently is, what you may have missed, and what you still have to look forward to.

## GOOD NIGHT

![goodnight](https://github.com/luvwitch/Day-Planner/blob/main/assets/goodnight.png?raw=true "good night")

The scheduler is finished off with a reminder to have a good night.
